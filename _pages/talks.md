Come join us and grow your public speaking skills!
## How to choose a topic

A lot of people struggle to know what to talk about. So long as you choose a topic that is related to Django, and is interesting to **you** then it's probably a good topic.

Remember that we are all about diversity -  you don't need to do a technical deep-dive or be a world-renowned expert to add value to the DjangoCon participants. 

If you are unsure of your talk topic then please reach out to us and we'll be happy to chat. Or you can just submit a proposal and see what happens.
## Selection Process

We’ll choose a selection of talks and tutorials that we feel add up to the most enjoyable and engaging program for our attendees. Volunteers from the Django community are invited to help us pick talks, and we rely heavily on them to help us select ones that are interesting and beneficial to our attendees. Community volunteers and conference organizers will review anonymized submissions and collectively decide which ones to accept.
