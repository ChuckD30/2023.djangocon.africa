## About the Conference

DjangoCon Africa will include 3 days of single-track talks, 1 day of workshops and sprints, and another day for touring for international visitors. 

The conference will feature talks about the Django Web Framework, related technologies and community. Whether you are an entry level, intermediate or advanced developer, DjangoCon Africa has something in stock for you.

To make the conference as inclusive as possible, the event will offer financial aid to members of under-represented communities in software to ensure they can also attend. 

The CFP, which is open to all, will also be announced as soon as key details are in place.

## Schedule

DjangoCon Africa will run from the 6th - the 11th of November 2023. The event will have three days of talks from the 7th - the 9th of November and two days of workshops from the 10th - the 11th of November 2023. The first day, the 6th of November will be an orientation and tour day for the participants to get to know one another while also exploring the city.

## Django Girls at DjangoCon Africa

Will there be a Django Girls workshop at DjangoCon Africa? 

Of course, there will be one! We are organizing Django Girls Zanzibar which will be held the weekend right before DjangoCon Africa. 

Django Girls Zanzibar will be held on the 4th of November 2023. We scheduled it before the conference to enable the attendees to attend DjangoCon Africa talks and sprints after attending the workshop and being introduced to Python and Django.
